It can be noted that selection sort
does not differ massively in performance between
the already sorted and randomly ordered
test cases. This is because the algorithm
has to swap every array element regardless
of any preordering, making its best, average, and worst
cases identical.\\
In contrast to this, bubble sort and insertion sort
are both much faster on already sorted arrays.
The time taken scales linearly as data increases,
confirming that their best case time complexity is O(n).\\
Randomly sorted arrays are the average case for all sorts.
With these test cases, run times increase by approximately
3.5x when the input size is doubled. This falls just below
the theoretical best case complexity of O($n^2$).\\
This occurs because the time complexity only considers the number
of comparisons, and disregards any swaps that occur
(which are generally more computationally intensive).\\
It can also be seen that selection sort performs better than insertion
sort, which performs better than bubble sort. This is also due to the 
number of swaps required.
